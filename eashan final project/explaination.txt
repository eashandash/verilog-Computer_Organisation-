Explaination 

Sir, we have done the single core processor. I (mpd15i017)  have tried to generate the output e^1.7 rather than e^17 as it would have required minimum 24+ terms in the taylor series  and tried to store in the memory.

What is done !


1)ALU
 I have integerated various adder,multiplier modules etc to form our ALU module
 32 bit 

2)instruction memory
 16 bit.
 the most significant 4 bits are for opcode
 the next four for operand 1
 the next four for operand 2
 the least significant 4 bits for the result


3)memory
 I intended to store data from memory to the instruction register and data registers and store the output from processor register back to memory .
 I however was not able to integrete the memory and register part with the ALU without any errors , which lead me to modify the ALU code to some extent inorder to get an approximate answer 
 Floating Point adder was giving me an unexpected output, which in turn was leading to an output which is approximately double of the expected one.


I have included whatever modules was possible from my side with least errors and modifications.
Though the individual modules are working fine independently, there were some issues we had to deal with in our attempt to integerate the modules
